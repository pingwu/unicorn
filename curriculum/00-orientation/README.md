# Phase 00: Orientation

**Welcome to the Unicorn Incubator**

---

## What Is This Incubator?

The Unicorn Incubator is a guided path from **raw expertise to a deployed landing page**. Not a coding bootcamp. Not a marketing course. A structured process for turning what you already know into something the world can see, use, and pay for.

You will work through the "Just Ask" framework -- a method grounded in a novel by Pinghsien Wu about a mid-career technologist who loses his job, spends eighteen months building things nobody asked for, and eventually discovers that the skill behind every breakthrough is the ability to ask the right question.

By the end, you will have:
- A content brief built from your own expertise and your audience's real needs
- A live landing page deployed to the internet
- A repeatable process (Writitation) for turning unclear ideas into clear action

## The Head and the Hand

The Unicorn Project is organized around a simple distinction:

**The Head** is your knowledge -- everything you know, the relationships you hold, the context behind your decisions. In this project, it lives in the `/knowledge/` directory, powered by Obsidian.

**The Hand** is your work -- the projects you ship, the code you deploy, the pages you publish. It lives in `/projects/`.

The curriculum sits between them. It takes what is in your head and gives your hand something to build.

Think of it this way: the Head accumulates. The Hand creates. The curriculum translates.

## Sovereign AI: Own What You Build

A core principle of the Unicorn Project is **digital sovereignty**. Everything you build here:

- Lives on **your computer**, in standard formats (React, HTML, CSS, Markdown)
- Can be **taken with you** -- no platform lock-in, no proprietary formats
- Is **yours permanently** -- not rented from a SaaS platform that can change terms, raise prices, or disappear

Traditional platforms trap you with proprietary systems and continuous subscriptions. The sovereign approach means you own the files, the code, and the deployment. When you finish this curriculum, the landing page is yours -- not a template locked inside someone else's builder.

## The Office Structure

The Unicorn Project operates like a one-person company with specialized "offices" -- each representing a capability you can invoke through AI agent skills:

| Office | Role | What It Does For You |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| CEO | Vision and strategy | Sets the direction for your landing page |
| CTO | Technology | Builds and deploys your site |
| CMO | Marketing | Shapes your messaging and positioning |
| CPO | Product | Defines what your audience actually needs |
| CFO | Finance | Keeps costs minimal and ROI clear |

You do not need to master each office. The AI agents handle the execution. Your job is to provide **clarity** -- and that is exactly what this curriculum trains.

## Agentic Development

This incubator uses **agentic development** -- describing what you want in natural language and letting AI handle the syntax, best practices, and file organization.

> "The new professional superpower is not coding; it's orchestrating AI agents to build for you."

You will use AI tools throughout this curriculum. Not as a replacement for thinking, but as an amplifier. The novel's central lesson applies here: **the quality of the output depends on the quality of the question**. A vague prompt produces vague results. A clear, honest question produces something you can use.

---

## The Writitation Practice

Every lesson in this curriculum includes a **Writitation** exercise -- a structured writing practice developed in the novel and formalized by David Lin's students.

The three steps:

1. **Observe** -- What is the current state? Write what you see, without editing or judging.
2. **Discern** -- What is the desired state? Write what you want, as specifically as you can.
3. **Validate with a Question** -- What one question, if answered, would confirm you are on the right track?

Writitation is not journaling (recording what happened) and not meditation (emptying the mind). It is **discovery through writing** -- catching thoughts before your conscious mind edits them.

Start now. Open a blank document or notebook and write for ten minutes:

> **What do I already know that I have never turned into something others can use?**

Do not edit. Do not organize. Just write. This is your incubator journal. You will return to it in every lesson.

## What You Need

| Tool | Purpose | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| Docker Desktop | Runs containers | [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) |
| Git | Version control | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |
| AI Coding Agent | Your development partner | [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) |

**Do NOT install:** Node.js, npm, Python, or any other development tools. Everything else runs inside the Docker container.

You will also need:
- A notebook or blank document for Writitation
- Willingness to ask honest questions

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Unicorn Project repository if you have not already
2. Follow the setup steps in [AGENTS.md Section 4](../../AGENTS.md) (symlink skills, start dev container)
3. Start Phase 01: [DELETE](../01-delete/README.md)

The deliverable chain begins with your first lesson: **The Close Button**.
