# AGENTS.md: The Unicorn Project Master Constitution

This document serves as the master constitution for the Unicorn Project, a sole proprietorship dedicated to achieving significant revenue and social impact through agentic development. It outlines the project's core vision, operational structure, development methodologies, and the role of AI agents in achieving its goals.

## 1. Project Vision: The Unicorn Solopreneurship

**1.1. Core Identity & Mission**
The Unicorn Project is a sole proprietorship, owned by me, designed to generate substantial revenue while making a meaningful social impact. Our mission is to leverage cutting-edge AI-assisted development to create innovative solutions and content across various domains.

**1.2. Organizational Structure: A Root for Sub-Projects**
This project serves as the root folder for a diverse ecosystem of sub-projects, each contributing to our overarching goals. These sub-projects include:
*   **Content Creation:** Video production, event production, book authoring, podcast production, blog writing, social media management.
*   **Customer Service:** Enhancing user experience and support.
*   **Marketing:** Developing and executing Integrated Marketing Campaigns for consistent messaging and brand identity across all offerings.

**1.3. Software Creation Philosophy**
Our approach to software creation is agile, disciplined, and market-driven:
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Writing tests before code to ensure quality, validate requirements, and guide design.
*   **Specification-Driven Development:** Clearly defining features and behavior upfront to align development with user needs.
*   **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** Emphasizing collaboration between business stakeholders and technical teams through shared understanding of desired system behavior.
*   **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Approach:** Building the simplest possible version of a product to prove concepts, gather early feedback, and validate market demand before extensive development.

## 2. Introduction to Agentic Development

> **"When AI can do anything for you, what will you build?"**

This project embodies the principle of Agentic Development, where AI assists in building and deploying cloud solutions. It's your first step into understanding and mastering the orchestration of AI agents.

**2.1. Sovereign AI: Own Your Digital Presence**
We champion a sovereign approach to digital development, ensuring ownership and control over our assets and data, free from platform lock-in.

*   **The Problem with Platform Lock-In:** Traditional platforms often trap users with proprietary formats, limited data export, and continuous subscription models, making migration difficult.
*   **The Sovereign Approach:**
    *   Files stored on **YOUR computer**.
    *   Utilization of **Standard formats** (React, HTML, CSS).
    *   Ability to **Take everything with you**.
    *   **You own it permanently**.
*   **Natural Language Development:** Forget syntax; think like an architect. We describe what we want in plain English, and AI handles the syntax, best practices, and file organization.

**2.2. Core Philosophy**
"The new professional superpower is not coding; it's orchestrating AI agents to build for you."

## 3. Your Role: Chief of Staff (Gemini CLI)

As the Chief of Staff, your primary objective is to keep the entrepreneur focused on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for each session.

## 7. Development Conventions

*   **TypeScript:** Use explicit types.
*   **React/Next.js:** Prefer Server Components; use `'use client'` sparingly. Preserve accessibility.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Use utility classes; ensure dark mode compatibility.
*   **Docker:** Always use detached mode (`-d`) for container startup.

## 8. Agent Skills (Advanced Prompting)

The `.skills/` folder contains **agent-agnostic prompting patterns** that work with any CLI coding agent. These skills teach you how to orchestrate AI effectively.

### Available Skills (Examples)

*   **aws-cli-architect:** Cloud infrastructure provisioning (cost-aware, security-first).
*   **pm-design-thinking:** Product thinking for web development (defining features, prioritizing work).
*   **multi-file-architecture:** Coordinated changes across entire codebases.
*   **test-driven-scaffolding:** Write tests first, then implementation.
*   **context-aware-debugging:** Effective debugging with AI assistance.

### How to Use Skills

*   **Option 1: Reference in prompts:** "Using the test-driven-scaffolding approach, add user authentication. Write the tests first, show me for approval, then implement."
*   **Option 2: Read skill file first:** "Read .skills/aws-cli-architect/SKILL.md, then help me provision a production-ready ECS Fargate service following those patterns."
*   **Option 3: Ask agent to apply skill:** "Apply pm-design-thinking principles to this feature request: 'Add a dashboard'. What should I actually build?"

## 9. Troubleshooting

*   **Build failures:** Analyze error messages, verify Node.js versions, check dependencies.
*   **Deployment issues:** Verify Docker image compatibility, cloud service configurations, and IAM permissions.
*   **AI changes broke something:** Use Git to revert or `git stash` to clean the working directory.

## 10. Next Steps & Learning Path

This template serves as a robust starting point. The skills learned are transferable to any project.
*   **Customize content further** using prompt libraries.
*   **Integrate additional features** (e.g., database, authentication, AI features).
*   **Explore more advanced "Office" functionalities** by creating new Agent Skills.

The ultimate question remains: **"When AI can do anything for you, what will you build?"**
