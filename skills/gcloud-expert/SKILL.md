# Gcloud Expert

## Overview

This skill enables Gemini CLI to act as an expert on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and provides comprehensive assistance with the `gcloud` command-line interface. It can help with understanding GCP services, generating `gcloud` commands for various operations, and offering guidance on best practices.

## Gcloud CLI Expertise

This skill can formulate and explain `gcloud` commands for managing a wide range of GCP resources, including:
*   **Compute Engine**: VMs, instances groups, disks, networks.
*   **Cloud Run**: Services, revisions, deployments.
*   **Cloud Storage**: Buckets, objects, access control.
*   **Cloud SQL**: Instances, databases, users.
*   **Networking**: VPCs, firewalls, load balancers.
*   And many other GCP services.

It can also interpret `gcloud` command output and troubleshoot common issues.

## Google Cloud Concepts

Leverage this skill for explanations and context regarding various Google Cloud services, their features, and how they integrate. It understands fundamental GCP concepts such as projects, organizations, IAM roles, regions, zones, and resource hierarchy.

## Best Practices

This skill can provide recommendations and guidance on Google Cloud best practices for security, cost optimization, performance, and operational excellence, especially when interacting with resources via `gcloud`.

## Examples of Use

*   "How do I deploy a new Cloud Run service named 'my-app' from a Docker image located at 'gcr.io/my-project/my-image'?"
*   "List all Compute Engine instances in the 'us-central1' region."
*   "Explain the difference between a Cloud Function and a Cloud Run service."
*   "What's the `gcloud` command to grant a user the 'Storage Object Admin' role on a specific Cloud Storage bucket?"
*   "Give me `gcloud` commands to create a new VPC network and a firewall rule to allow HTTP traffic."
