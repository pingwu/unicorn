# John Smith — AI Orchestration Architect

## Who I Am

I'm John Smith — an engineer, systems thinker, and builder at heart. I grew up fascinated by how things connect and work together. That curiosity led me from computer engineering to distributed systems to where I am today: designing intelligent systems where AI agents collaborate to solve problems no single model can tackle alone.

I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford and a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan. But the credentials matter less than the journey — nine years of building, breaking, and rebuilding systems taught me that the best architectures come from deeply understanding the people who use them.

## What I Do

I design and build AI orchestration systems — the invisible layer that coordinates multiple AI agents, language models, and data sources into something that actually works in the real world.

In practical terms, I help organizations figure out:
- Which tasks should be handled by AI agents and which need human judgment
- How to route work to the right model at the right cost
- How to make retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) reliable at scale
- How to move from an impressive demo to a production system people depend on

I've built multi-agent platforms that process millions of documents, intelligent routing layers that cut AI costs by more than half, and orchestration systems adopted across entire engineering organizations.

## What Impact Do I Make

**For the teams I work with** — I turn overwhelming AI complexity into clear, buildable architectures. Engineers I've mentored tell me the most valuable thing I gave them wasn't a technical pattern — it was a way of thinking about *why* a system should exist before *how* to build it.

**For the businesses I serve** — I help them stop experimenting with AI and start operating with it. The document processing system I designed gave back thousands of hours of human review time. The cost optimization work I've done has saved organizations hundreds of thousands in compute spend. These aren't abstract metrics — they're people getting home earlier and budgets funding the next hire.

**For the broader community** — I believe AI orchestration knowledge shouldn't be locked inside big tech companies. I'm working toward sharing what I've learned — through open-source contributions, writing, and mentoring — so that smaller teams and independent builders can access the same patterns.

My goal is simple: make AI systems that serve people well, and help others learn to build them too.
